# Summary

Gold standard Universal Dependencies corpus for Ukrainian, developed for UD originally, by [Institute for Ukrainian](https://mova.institute), NGO.  
[[українською](https://mova.institute/золотий_стандарт)]


# Introduction

UD Ukrainian comprises 100K tokens in 5873 sentences of fiction, news, opinion articles, Wikipedia, legal documents, letters, posts, and comments — from the last 15 years, as well as from the first half of the 20th century.

### Annotation procedure

Morphology is annotated using 2+1 schema. The syntax is single-pass plus supervisor’s check.
Consistency is further enforced by ~200 validation and autofix [rules](https://github.com/mova-institute/lib/blob/master/src/nlp/ud/validation.ts) and by investigating errors made by a trained parser.


### Data split

Data is split between train/dev/test linearly by hand at 75%/10%/15% to balance in genre and complexity. Some large documents are divided across datasets.


### Format

UD Ukrainian data conforms to [CoNLL-U](http://universaldependencies.org/format.html) format with the following specifics:
* Sentence-level comments:
  * Document boundaries are present as `# newdoc id = xxxx`.
  * Sentence-level paragraph boundaries are present as `# newpar id = xxxx`.
  * Document titles are present as `# doc_title = Назва`.
  * Gaps in the text are marked on the sentences following the gap as:
    * `# annotation_gap` for sentences not exported to CoNLL-U because annotator was unable to parse it with confidence (new guidelines need to be created etc.);
    * `# gap` for intentional gaps in texts (selected fragments).
* XPOSTAG column contains [MTE](http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V4/msd/html/msd-uk.html) tag with `U` for punctuation. UPOS+FEATS contain all the information in XPOSTAG and more. XPOSTAG is intended for legacy applications.
* No enhanced dependencies or empty nodes present in DEPS column.
* MISC column:
  * Token-level paragraph boundaries are present as `NewPar=Yes`.
  * Token ids are present as `Id=xxxx`.
  * `SpaceAfter=No` markers are present.
* Document, paragraph, sentence, and token ids are 4-character base-32 numbers. They survive treebank updates.


### Development
Data files are built from sources at [mova-institute/zoloto](https://github.com/mova-institute/zoloto), where actual development happens.
